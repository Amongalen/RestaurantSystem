A restaurant system which allows ordering food. It allows ordering a lunch or/and a drink. In case of the drink it's possible to add a lemon or/and ice cubes. All lunch meals are grouped by cuisines. To a lunch meal one may add a dessert as well. As an output the program displays ordered food and total price.

The whole menu with cuisines, meals and prices is stored in a menu.csv file. 
To add new cuisines or meals you can simply add a new line(s) to that file following this format: 

```
category;name;price
```
The *category* may be a drink, a dessert or a name of the cuisine (either new or existing one).
